# C++ Labs
C++ Course Laborations made during spring 2021 during the course "Object Oriented Programming with C++", Linnaeus University.
Labs are divided into 4 folders named Step1 - Step4. 

Step1 is about "Program Quality" - to effectively and successfully debug, reuse, maintain and develop programs that you or others have written, but also to achieve greater and more specialized applications. 
Step 2_1 is about "Object life cycles". From Lab PM: Several objects are usually created and destroyed during the time a program executes. Some objects exist throughout the execution (e.g., application object), while others are created, used, and removed in a matter of seconds. This lab is designed to take a closer look at objects’ lifetime, and to give some clues on how to best design and develop programs.
Step 2_2 is about creating an own String class, which can handle some common operations on strings.
Step 3_1 is about creating a class TextHandler that reads a number of separated texts from a text file and stores pointers to each text. 
Step 3_2 is about writing a program capable of playing different games. Since games are to be changed from case to case, it is convenient to write the program as a framework where actual games are located in adaptation classes. Then, you can create different gaming object that can be plugged into the framework as required. I choosed to simulate roulette game.
Step 4. In this lab, the task is to implement a collection management application named CatalogApplication that supports records of several types (e.g., music albums, postage stamps, and plants—all with their own custom fields), stores them persistently in a file, and provides users with a text menu-based interface capable of creating, reading, and deleting record operations.
